# ACCENT_AWARE_SPEECH_RECONNIZATION_SYSTEM
This Project implements a deep learning-based ASR system with speaker adaptation and data augmentation
# Accent-Aware Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System

## Overview

This project focuses on building an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that is designed to be more robust to variations in speaker accents. It leverages deep learning techniques, including speaker adaptation and data augmentation, to improve the model's ability to accurately transcribe speech from diverse speakers.

## Key Components

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Utilizes `datasets` and `torchaudio` to load and prepare speech datasets.
- **Feature Extraction:** Employs libraries like `librosa` to extract relevant audio features (e.g., MFCCs).
- **Noise Reduction:** Integrates `noisereduce` to minimize the impact of background noise on ASR performance.
- **Model Building:** Leverages pre-trained models from `transformers` as a foundation for the ASR system.
- **Speaker Adaptation:** Implements techniques to adapt the model to different speaker characteristics.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applies various audio augmentations to increase the diversity of the training data and improve generalization across accents.
- **Evaluation:** Uses `jiwer` to calculate the Word Error Rate (WER), a standard metric for evaluating ASR accuracy.

## Installation

1.  **Install required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install librosa torchaudio jiwer noisereduce datasets transformers
    ```
2.  **Download necessary datasets:** (The notebook will likely handle this programmatically using the `datasets` library).

## Usage

The provided notebook (`Accent_Aware_ASR_Colab_Notebook.ipynb` or `Accent_Aware_ASR_Colab_Notebook (1).ipynb`) contains the complete implementation of the project. To run it:

1.  Open the notebook in Google Colab or a Jupyter environment.
2.  Follow the cells in the notebook, executing them sequentially.

## Plain Explanation

Imagine teaching a computer to understand what people are saying. This project aims to make that computer better at understanding people even if they have different accents.

Think of it like this: if you only ever hear people with one type of accent, you might find it a bit harder to understand someone with a very different accent. This project tries to solve that problem for computers that are learning to understand speech.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Getting the Audio:** First, we need lots of recordings of people speaking. The project uses special tools to easily get these recordings (like a digital library of spoken words).
2.  **Preparing the Audio:** Just like cleaning up a messy audio recording, the project uses tools to reduce background noise so the computer can focus on the speech. It also extracts important features from the sound, kind of like picking out the key ingredients from a recipe.
3.  **Using a Smart Starting Point:** Instead of starting from scratch, the project uses a pre-trained "brain" (a model) that already knows a lot about language. This saves time and helps the system learn faster.
4.  **Learning Different Accents:** The project uses special tricks to help the computer get used to different ways people pronounce words. It might slightly change the audio to sound like someone with a different accent, which helps the computer become more adaptable.
5.  **Testing How Well It Listens:** Finally, the project checks how accurately the computer can understand speech by comparing its transcriptions to the actual words spoken. It uses a score called "Word Error Rate" to measure its performance.

In simple terms, this project is about building a speech recognition system that is fair and accurate for people with various accents, making it more useful for everyone.

1.  **Copy the README content:** Select all the text above (both the Markdown and the plain explanation) and copy it.
2.  **Create a text file:** Open a plain text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or a similar editor on Linux).
3.  **Paste the README content:** Paste the copied text into the text editor.
4.  **Save the README:** Save the file as `README.md` (for the Markdown version) and another file as `README_plain.txt` (for the plain text version).
5.  **Zip the files:**
    * **Windows:** Right-click on the `README.md` and `README_plain.txt` files, go to "Send to," and then click "Compressed (zipped) folder."
    * **Mac:** Select both files, right-click (or Control-click), and choose "Compress."
    * **Linux:** You can use the `zip` command in the terminal: `zip readme_files.zip README.md README_plain.txt`

This will create a zip file containing the README in both Markdown and plain text formats. Let me know if you have any other questions!
